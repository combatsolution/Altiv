Executive Summary\n\nAccenture’s company-wide FOBO analysis reveals a robust multi-domain expertise spanning product management, software engineering, marketing, and data science. Across these domains, teams demonstrate deep capabilities in agile methodologies, cloud-native development, digital marketing, and advanced analytics. However, significant opportunities lie in rapidly accelerating AI-readiness, boosting automation, and strengthening cross-functional collaboration. With a Final FOBO score of 59.5, the enterprise must address a relatively low automation capacity (12.7%) while leveraging human-centric and augmentation strengths (40.2% and 46.9% respectively). The transformation priority is to harness advanced predictive analytics, generative AI, and automated processes to create a cohesive, agile, and data-driven enterprise culture that underpins rapid innovation, operational excellence, and industry thought leadership.\n\n# 2.
